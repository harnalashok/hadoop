            "there are dreams   there are characters coming back from the dead   there are others who look like the dead   there are strange apparitions   there are disappearances   there are a looooot of chase scenes   there are tons of weird things that happen   and most of it is simply not explained . \n",
            "now i personally don't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then   but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again   i get kind of fed up after a while   which is this film's biggest problem . \n",

            "overall   the film doesn't stick because it doesn't entertain   it's confusing   it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime   despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it . \n",

            "it's got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother ( william this time ) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on . \n",
            "little do they know the power within . . . \n",
            "going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there   virus still feels very empty   like a movie going for all flash and no substance . \n",
            "we don't know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere   we don't know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir )   and   of course   we don't know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout . \n",
            "here   it's just \" hey   let's chase these people around with some robots \" . \n",
            "the acting is below average   even from the likes of curtis . \n",
            "you're more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20 . \n",
            "sutherland is wasted and baldwin   well   he's acting like a baldwin   of course . \n",
            "the real star here are stan winston's robot design   some schnazzy cgi   and the occasional good gore shot   like picking into someone's brain . \n",

            "even the characters stink -- none of them are remotely interesting   so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can out-bland the others . \r\n",
            "in the end   it's a tie -- they all win . \r\n",
            "that dragon's comedy shtick is awfully cloying   but at least it shows signs of a pulse . \r\n",
            "at least fans of the early-'90s tgif television line-up will be thrilled to find jaleel \" urkel \" white and bronson \" balki \" pinchot sharing the same footage . \r\n",
            "a few scenes are nicely realized ( though i'm at a loss to recall enough to be specific )   and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic ( though most are paired up with singers who don't sound a thing like them for their big musical moments -- jane seymour and celine dion ? ? ? ) . \r\n",
            "but one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good . \r\n",
            "aside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults   \" quest for camelot \" 's most grievous error is its complete lack of personality . \r\n",

            "unfortunately   shao khan was a poor loser   and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway   ready to take over the planet   as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . \n",
            "the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . \n",
            "i'd even go so far as to say that many folks who didn't know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . \n",
            "the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself   and they didn't try to overachieve . \n",
            "there were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music )   intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . \n",
            "and   as we know   the movie was a smashing success at the box office . \n",
            "mortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off   with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . \n",
            "shao khan has decided that he's going to take over the earth * anyways *   and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . \n",
            "thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused   being trite   being silly   and being just plain stupid . \n",
            "one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought \" hey   that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . \" \n",
            "too bad they didn't simply stick with the formula from the first movie . \n",
            "i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture   but here are the high points : \n",
            " * the acting is truly bad . \n",
            "sandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable   especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . \n",
            " * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i've * ever * seen   james remar plays raiden   the god of thunder . \n",
            "in the first movie   christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . \n",
            "i generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim \" tiny \" lister   jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element   for example )   and remar has always been one of my favorite \" utility \" actors but he's so totally wrong for this part that he doesn't even have the luxury of amused self-awareness . \n",
            " * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important   but then never seen again . \n",
            " * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks   including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot )   has a mystical hallucination   and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . \n",
            "for these reasons ( and many others )   i can only give the movie a 2 . . . \n",
            " . . . unless you're a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . \n",
            "in that case   the following critiques also apply : \n",
            " * sandra hess   while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie )   is much more convincing as a fighter . \n",
            "wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . \n",
            "hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts   and puts together a much more believable fight scene . \n",
            " * in the fights   each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . \n",
            "sonya does her \" kiss of death   \" jax does his \" earthquake   \" liu kang does his \" animality   \" and so on . \n",
            "a big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . \n",
            " * there aren't as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first   because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . \n",
            "silly   silly folks . \n",
            "and the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match . \n",
            "lame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect   for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . \n",
            " * the special effects are generally better   except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their \" animalities . \" \n",
            "motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie . \n",
            "for folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games   i give this a 5 . \n",
            "you'll probably like it   but not nearly as much as you liked the first one . \n",

        "    \"\"\"William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, software developer, investor, and philanthropist. He is best known as the co-founder of Microsoft Corporation. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014. He is one of the best-known entrepreneurs and pioneers of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s. Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, Gates co-founded Microsoft with childhood friend Paul Allen in 1975, in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it went on to become the world's largest personal computer software company. Gates led the company as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, but he remained chairman and became chief software architect. During the late 1990s, Gates had been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings. In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning to a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation that he and his wife, Melinda Gates, established in 2000.[9] He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie. He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.\"\"\",\n",
